NSD Term Project
================

This is the directory for the term project proposal.  To turn it in, you need
**a PR** and **an E3 entry for the PR URL**.  See
https://yyc.solvcon.net/en/latest/nsd/schedule/23au_nycu/schedule23au.html for
what should be included in the proposal and project.

The proposal accounts for 8 points out of the 40 points allocated to the term
project.  Like homework, you will need to create a PR against the ``project``
branch (not ``master``).  You need to create a sub-directory using exactly your
GitHub username as your working directory (``nsdhw_23au/project/$username/``).
The hierarchy should be like::

  - nsdhw_23au (<- repository root)
    - project
      - username (<- your working directory)
        - README.rst (<- the main proposal file)
        - ... other files for your proposal

**ATTENTION**: Your PR should include an entry in "Project List by Account
Name" in this file.

When submitting your proposal, name the PR as ``<username>-proposal**``, e.g.,
``yungyuc-proposal-submission``.  Don't forget to put the PR URL in the E3
entry too.  You can request my review in the PR.

Presentation
============

The presentation schedule is set.  If you want to change the time, ask for the
owner of the other time slot and file a PR tagging him or her and the
instructor (@yungyuc) against the branch `master`.  Everyone involved needs to
respond to agree the exchange in the PR.  The PR subject line should start with
``[presentation]``.

Each presentation can use at most 15 minutes.  Presenters may decide how to use
their time.  A possible arrangement is to use 13 minutes in the presentation
itself and 2 minutes for questions and discussions.

Presenters should prepare the computer for presentation.  It is OK for
presenters to share a computer.  Setting up the computer is included in the
allotted presentation time.  If presenters have difficulty in preparing a
computer themselves, they may seek help from the instructor, and resolve the
issue one week before their presentation.


NOTE: If there is difficulty in preparing a computer for presentation, please
discuss with the instructor two weeks before the presentation.
